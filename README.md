Red Carrot Debug
========

Written by Andrew Fairlie from redcarrot.co.uk for the ExpressionEngine community.

An ExpressionEngine plugin that outputs useful data to help folks on StackExchange debug problems.

## Usage
- Add a new blank template including only `{exp:rc_debug}`
- View the page, enter the source code so that it is formatted correctly and copy the contents
- Paste into StackExchange, removing any elements you aren't comfortable with sharing


## Future Improvements
- Member Groups Overview
- Config Variables Overview
- Multiple Site Manager Support
- Snippet Overview
- Global Variables Overview


## Etiquette
I propose that people add the output of their  `{exp:rc_debug}` to the bottom of their questions on Stack Exchange. The markdown generates a horizontal line which will separate their question and their debug output.
